 START_SCREEN_EMEX_SEEDED: "Our past is now distant, mostly forgotten. The Unification is the only event we know.\n\nAncient beings descended upon our ancestors, holding abilities of no mere mortal. They remained stoic and isolated, but they always returned. They remained inquisitive, but they always refused to communicate.\n\nAnd yet, their sudden and permanent absence was soon followed by our awakening - our Unification.\n\nNow, our collective mind has developed space travel, and with it, we may uncover what we lost, and what was hidden."

 emex_origin2.5.desc: "If our Collective is to discover the entire truth and identity of the arcane Seeders, we must focus our efforts on studying anomalies which seemingly relate to their past actions within our star cluster.\n\nA legion of brain-drones have concluded that there are currently 3 potential points of interest relating to these strange aliens of the past. No doubt, new leads and paths will be uncovered in the future to further our knowledge. What path we choose to pursue will be decided by the Hive Mind."

 EMEX_SEEDED_PATH1: "World of Grey"
 EMEX_SEEDED_PATH1_DESC: "This world is almost entirely covered in a strange layer of rapidly-transforming and reacting nanomachines. Initial scans reveal very little about what is beneath these machines."
 emex_origin2.100.name: "World of Grey"
 emex_origin2.100.desc: "Our scans of [emex_seeder_sp1_planet0.GetName] have not yielded any useful results. As expected, the entire planet is covered in a ever-shifting ocean of nanoscopic machines. Any attempts at sending both organic and inorganic material towards the surface of the planet has resulted in the monotone sea subsuming the material even before it approached the surface of the grey tides. As such, the nanomachines must be removed for more progress to be made.\n\nBy capturing some rogue, potentially defective samples stuck in low-orbit around [emex_seeder_sp1_planet@root.GetName], our research drones have begun experimenting on these automatons. Despite their destructiveness, the design appears to be somewhat crude, potentially a prototype of some kind that went rampant. Nonetheless, they will require time and resources to discover a solution."
 emex_origin2.100.1: "Devise a corrosive agent against the machines."
 emex_origin2.100.2: "Find a way to lure the machines away from the planet."
 emex_origin2.101.name: "What Lays Beneath"
 emex_origin2.101.A.desc: "After many weeks, a breakthrough has been made regarding the removal of the nanomachines engulfing [emex_seeder_sp1_planet@root.GetName]. Under extremely specific conditions, the core alloy used in the nanites can be broken down into its constituent elements, rendering them unable to function and coordinate with one another. While most of the resultant material can be discarded, the alloy has a low composition of several rare metals which hold highly durable and resistant properties; collecting these should prove beneficial.\n\nThe procedure itself was quick to end, as small quantities of the corrosive agent could be used to disable many hundreds of thousands nanomachines within seconds. Now, with [emex_seeder_sp1_planet@root.GetName] cleared of the grey sea, our expedition drones should be able to land safely."
 emex_origin2.101.B.desc: "After many weeks, a breakthrough has been made regarding the removal of the nanomachines engulfing [emex_seeder_sp1_planet@root.GetName]. While the technology behind the nanites remains unknown, each nanomachine cooperates with nearby nanomachines through the emittance of several different frequencies beyond the hearing range of the typical [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] drone. After isolating the meaning and intention behind several key frequencies, our research drones have managed to devise a plan where the nanites on [emex_seeder_sp1_planet@root.GetName] will follow a frequency commanding them to move to the location of the emittance.\n\nThe procedure itself was quick to end, as a miniscule satellite near the planet was able to attract the nanomachines away from the world. Now, with [emex_seeder_sp1_planet@root.GetName] cleared of the grey sea, our expedition drones should be able to land safely."
 emex_origin2.101.1: "Good. Let's begin the survey."
 EMEX_SEEDED_PATH1_part2: "[emex_seeder_sp1_planet@root.GetName]: Expedition"
 EMEX_SEEDED_PATH1_part2_DESC: "[emex_seeder_sp1_planet@root.GetName] was, until recently, home to a sea of nanomachines. While very little remains, various towns and structures litter the surface of the planet. These structures seem millennia-old, and will be very unstable.\n\nOur expedition team must be swift."
 emex_origin2.102.name: "Surface Expedition Complete"
 emex_origin2.102.desc: "The expedition exploring the various structures on the surface of [emex_seeder_sp1_planet@root.GetName] has concluded, for now. Unfortunately, the grey slurry of nanomachines must have caused severe structural damage to most of the constructions on the planet, as a large majority of the buildings are barren on the inside as well as appearing derelict from the outside. Only a few vaults locked underground and some skyscrapers of some kind that reached above the sea of grey remained safe, allowing our team to learn about the world.\n\n[emex_seeder_sp1_planet@root.GetName] was undoubtedly a young colony of some kind, belonging a race of hyper-advanced aliens called the §YVilnar§! many millennia ago. While there have been no mentions of the societal structure of the Vilnar, their documents refer to §Y'the Junta'§! a few times, and make several references to ongoing conflicts at the time. We can assume the Junta is the ruling power of the Vilnar, and they seemingly were developing weapons of war on [emex_seeder_sp1_planet@root.GetName]. Most notably among the various files is the existence of some §HProject Silverstorm§!. Almost all details have been redacted, however.\n\nWhile there is the possibility of further discoveries to be made, the few remaining structures on the planet are collapsing, thanks to the ravenous nanomachines. Time is limited."
 emex_origin2.102.1: "Salvage what you can."
 emex_origin2.102.2: "Find some data on this Silverstorm."
 emex_origin2.103.name: "Expedition Completed"
 emex_origin2.103.A.desc: "Our expedition drones were mostly successful in salvaging all artifacts, items, documents and other items of interest with the last standing buildings of [emex_seeder_sp1_planet@root.GetName]. A few additional caches of resources, most likely intended for military research, were also uncovered in our survey.\n\nWhile nothing was learnt in regards to the mysterious Project Silverstorm, some of the data gathered and decrypted by our team go into detail about various technologies and fields of research previously unknown to us. While a lot of the information is unintelligble or remains a secret, some aspects will greatly boost our research capabilities for a time.\n\nAll the artifacts and items gathered have been safely stored on [Root.capital_scope.GetName], and will no doubt aid future exploration."
 emex_origin2.103.B.desc: "Our expedition drones were only somewhat successful in uncovering further details about the unknown Project Silverstorm. Most importantly, an encrypted storage device was located alongside piles of notes and diagrams which are too illegible and messy to make out properly. The decryption process has begun, but it seems as though a lot of the data on the device has already been expunged.\n\nSome information can still be gleaned, however: as expected, the nanomachines previously covering [emex_seeder_sp1_planet@root.GetName] were indeed a part of Project Silverstorm, though to what extent--this is not known. Some samples of inert nanomachines, seemingly of older design, were retrieved alongside data about their potential non-military uses. The Vilnar on this world were clearly trying to synthesize some form of exotic matter capable of unique properties which would suit them to war and industrial use.\n\nThe data recovered has been safely stored and will no doubt aid future exploration and research capabilities."
 emex_origin2.103.1: "Good work."
